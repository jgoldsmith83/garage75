## Node HTTP Server examples

All of these example servers spin up on port 8000 so you can only run one at a time.

The servers in the [basic server folder](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-http-server/tree/master/example/basic) are just static file servers, and the servers in the [advanced server folder](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-http-server/tree/master/example) are dynamic server side rendering examples.
